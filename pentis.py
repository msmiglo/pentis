"""
Playfield is a rectangular lattice consisting of Spaces.
Spaces form rows horizontally and columns vertically.
Each Space has Coordinates.
Space can be empty or filled with a Square or with a Block.
Square is the smallest entity in game, it can fill exactly one Space.
Piece is a game entity which is consisted of 5 orthogonally adjacent Squares.
Pieces can move downward or be rotated during their freefall.
When a Piece hits the ground its Squares turn into Blocks.
Block is a Square with fixed position in the Playfield.
When the whole row is filled with Blocks, it is removed.
Exactly one Piece is present on the playfield.
When a Piece is turned into Blocks, the next Piece is generated on top of Playfield.

Game is a class containing a state of game and its behaviour.
Window is a class responsible for GUI.
Game and Window are independent and encapsulated classes.
Application is a controller class containing Game and Window.
Application class is responsible for communication between Window and Game.
Application class manages threads.
